In 3 simple steps you can add .netCHARTING to the Global
Assembly Cache and use it anywhere in your server:

Step 1:
- create a "dotnetcharting" directory under your CommonApplicationData
directory (e.g. "C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\dotnetcharting")
-move dotnetcharting.dll and your purchase key (.lic file) into this directory. 
The "dotnetcharting" directory must be created in the CommonApplicationData directory and 
ensure that read permissions are granted on the key file.

Step 2:
-Note: "Microsoft .NET framework 2.0 Configuration" does not install by 
default with .NET Framework
2.0 Redistributable Package (it is part of the SDK which can be downloaded
from http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/downloads/updates/default.aspx)

-Open "Microsoft .NET framework Configuration" from
Start > Settings > Control Panel > Administrative Tools
-Choose "Assembly Cache" Node.
-Click on "Add an Assembly to the Assembly Cache".
-Select dotnetcharting.dll from the directory created in step 1.

Alternatively you can drag / drop the assembly to the c:\windows\assembly 
directory using windows explorer to add it to the GAC.  This does not require 
the SDK.  The path may differ on your system as it is based on the windows 
system directory.


step 3:
-Open your machine.config or web.config file and add the following
entry in the <compilation> <assemblies> section. Because in ASP.NET 2.0 these elements don't exist in the config files by default, you must add them in <system.web> section:
<system.web>
......
	<compilation>
 		<assemblies>

		<add assembly="dotnetcharting, Version=4.4.2848.18442, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=af2cd47db69d93bd"/>
		
		</assemblies>
	</compilation>
......

<system.web>

Note: If you have a newer version of dotnetcharting dll, please
check the dll version by right clicking on dotnetcharting.dll and
use the version number reported by the version tab instead.
